This is the first non-tutorial app I ever made.

I made this for a local business who wanted an app for an iPad that is dedicated to only this app and sits in their break room and serves as a "kiosk" where employees can easily enter dollar amounts for snacks they take that are provided by the company.  Then at the end of every month the company deducts the total dollar amount of snacks taken from the employee's paychecks. 

The app has two main sections:

1. Employee facing section where employees tap their name in the list of all employees which takes them to another view where they can enter the dollar amount for the snack they are taking.
2. Admin section that is pass code protected where the employer can add/remove employees, view/email monthly totals, add/remove reporting emails.

This was a simple app but I thought it was solid for being the first app I ever made.  The company is still using the app without any issues.  I never attempted to get this on the app store since it was mostly a one off solution for this company.  If I were to do this app again today with what I know now the biggest thing I would change is to implement a back end solution that stores the data in a database and automatically emails the totals to the employer each month.  I would also not use Interface Builder because I have since found that I prefer doing all UI stuff in code.
